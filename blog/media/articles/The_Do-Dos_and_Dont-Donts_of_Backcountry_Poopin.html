<h2><b>The Do-Do’s and Don’t-Don’ts of Backcountry Poopin’</b></h2>
<p>It’s not hard to see the allure of a multi-day backpacking trip.  More time on the
    trail means more time off the grid and more time to reflect and decompress in nature.
    I’ve noticed that one of the biggest causes of anxiety for first time backpackers is
    their bowel movements.  Namely, they worry about pooping outside.  While I’m not one
    of those trail people that will tell you digging a cat-hole in the woods is a far
    superior experience to using a clean flush toilet, I will say that it doesn’t have
    to be an altogether unpleasant experience either.  I’ve compiled some tips to keep
    the focus of your upcoming trip on the trail in front of you and not what’s left
    behind.

<h5><b>Your food has a huge effect on your ability to “go” when you want to.</b></h5>
<p>Perhaps more worrisome than actually using a cat-hole is the thought that you migh
    t be out hiking for days without a good bowel movement.  If you’re like me and a
    daily banana and coffee are the keys to get things moving, it’s probably worth a
    little extra pack weight to bring fresh fruit and coffee.  Moreover if you’re not
    usually one for processed foods you might want to try to avoid (as much as
    possible) the oreos and poptarts, even though they are deliciously calorie dense.
    Packing out fresh foods like avocados, bananas, or even cherry tomatoes for a few
    days can make the difference between being constipated or not.
